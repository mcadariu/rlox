# rlox

A Rust implementation of the Lox bytecode virtual machine from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). This project follows the book's `clox` interpreter but is implemented in Rust instead of C.

At this moment it is in progress and can handle simple expressions, like `!(5 - 4 > 3 * 2 == !nil)`.
