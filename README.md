# rlox

An implementation of the bytecode virtual machine for Lox, the programming language in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). This project follows the book's `clox` interpreter but is implemented in Rust instead of C.

At this moment it can handle simple programs like: 

```java
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
print a + b;
```
