# rlox

A Rust implementation of the Lox bytecode virtual machine from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). This project follows the book's `clox` interpreter but is implemented in Rust instead of C.

At the moment it can handle only very simple expressions, like `3 + 4 * 5`.
